The PlayBot works with Xchat/Hexchat and requires the python 2 or 3 plugin to be loaded.

Here are some instructions on how to get this working if do not know already.  
Open the Plugins and Scripts sections.  
Make sure the Python Plugin is running.  
Load the playbot.  
When it is loaded a message should come up "Playbot Activated".  
To get the bot to play you need to use the command in the game channel /login charname password.  
Obviously replacing the charname with your character's name and the password with your character's password.
